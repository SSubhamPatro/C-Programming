2.Assignment Operators
read 2 numbers(a,b) from user using scanf and perform below operations and print output.



Assignment Operators



1) a += b

2) a -= b

3) a *= b

4) a /= b

5) a %= b
Sample Input
a=10 and b=5 
Sample Output
a += b: 15

a -= b: 10

a *= b: 50

a /= b: 10

a %= b: 0

3.takes details of an employee from the user
Write a program that takes details of an employee from the user, including name, employee ID, designation, and salary. Then, print the details of the employee.
Sample Input
Enter employee name: rohit

Enter employee ID: 101

Enter employee designation: development 

Enter employee salary: 25000
Sample Output
Employee Details

Name: rohit

Employee ID: 101

Designation: development

Salary: $25000.00

3.Logical Operators
read 2 numbers(a,b) from user using scanf and perform below operations and print output.



Logical Operators

1) a && b

2) a || b

3) !a

4) !b

Sample Input
 a=1, b=0
Sample Output
a && b = 0

a || b = 1

!a = 0

!b = 1

4.Bitwise Operators
ead 2 numbers(a,b) from user using scanf and perform below operations and print output.





Bitwise Operators



1) a & b

2) a | b

3) a ^ b

4) ~a 

5) a << 1

6) a >> 1

Sample Input
 a=5 and b=9
Sample Output
a & b = 1

a | b = 13

a ^ b = 12

~a = 4294967290

a << 1 = 10

a >> 1 = 2

5.Operation Using Scanf Function
 Write a C program that takes two integers and operator (+,-,*,/) as input from the user using scanf and perforom calculates their sum, substraction, multiplication, and division.
Sample Input
Enter 1st number 

20

Enter 2nd number

10

Enter operator (+,-,/,*)

+
Sample Output
addition = 30

6.Relational Operators
read 2 numbers(x,y) from user using scanf and perform below operations and print output.



Relational Operators

1) x==y

2) x!=y

3) x>y

4) x<y

5) x>=y

6) x<=y

Sample Input
ix=5 and y=8 
Sample Output
x == y = 0

x != y = 1

x > y = 0

x < y = 1

x >= y = 0

x <= y = 1
