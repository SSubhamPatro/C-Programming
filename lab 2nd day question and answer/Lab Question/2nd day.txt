1.write a 'c' program to find previous multiple of 10 of given two-digit number only.
sample input a=26
output 20

2.write a 'c' program to find next multiple of 10 of given 2 digit number only.
sample input a=34
output 40

3.without using control statements Write a c program to determine the next or previous multiple of 10 for a given two-digit number.

req:
     if the last digit of the given number is greater than or equal to 5 , the programme should print the next multiple of 10.
 
     if the last digit of the given number is less than 5 the program should print the previous multiple of 10.


sample input : int a = 34;
sample output : 30

sample input : int a = 25;
sample output : 30

sample input : int a = 86
sample output : 90

4. Write a 'c' program to check and print that the given number is Even or Odd without using ternary operator and control statement.
......

sample input : int a = 10
sample output : Even

sample input : int a = 15
sample output : Odd

5. write a 'c' program to find maximum number among two numbers without using ternary operator and control statement.

sample input : int a = 10 , b= 20
sample output :max =  20
